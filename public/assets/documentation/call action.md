### Action Node

The **Action Node** is designed to send requests in the specified Ros2 action. This node features two distinct outputs:

1. **Progress Output:**
   - Provides information on the progress of the action.

2. **Result Output:**
   - Outputs the final result of the action.

This node is particularly useful for handling Ros2 actions, allowing for clear segregation of progress updates and final results in your workflow.
