### Delay Node

The **Delay Node** introduces a delay to be applied to the message within a flow graph. This delay can be optionally defined as random.

The delay node operates without blocking the overall execution of the graph; it only delays the processing of the current node, allowing subsequent nodes to continue processing without interruption.
