### Error Node

The **Error Node** is designed to trigger an error popup for users, providing a clear message indicating the reason for the error. Several options can be configured:

#### Close Automatically:
- The message popup will automatically close after 5 seconds.
- This option is enabled by default.

#### Need Acknowledgement:
- The popup will require acknowledgment from the user.
- This ensures that the user has read the indications provided by the error.

Errors do not stack up. If multiple errors with the same text are triggered, multiple popups will not appear simultaneously.
