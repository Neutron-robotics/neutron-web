### Base Controller

The **Base Controller** node implements the base controller interface, defining the event triggered when a UI component, incorporating this connector, is interacted with by the user.

This controller component facilitates the movement of a wheeled robot within a two-dimensional space. The component triggers each time an input is pressed. Additionally, modifying the speed slider will also trigger the component.
